- Complaint Filing (with timestamp)
- View Complaint History
- Raise Emergency Alert (with real-time timestamp)
- Persistent Data Storage (.txt files)
- Modular Layered Architecture
- Robust Error Handling & Input Validation

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- File Handling (BufferedReader, FileWriter)
- Scanner-based Console UI
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or later installed

javac */*.java *.java
java Main

## 🧪 Input Validations

- Username and password must not be empty
- Duplicate usernames are rejected during registration
- Complaint content must be non-empty
- Invalid menu options show error messages without crashing

## 💥 Emergency Alert Feature

Users can raise an emergency alert at any time. The alert is instantly displayed on screen with a timestamp and the user's name.

Example:
[EMERGENCY] Alert from abhinav_jha at 2025-06-08 19:22:13

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability

- Fully tested on Java JDK 17
- Input validation across all major user inputs
- Files auto-create if not present (users.txt, complaints.txt)
- Error handling prevents crashes and guides user on invalid actions
- Clean and intuitive CLI for all user roles
